B                       E                #F            #Dm   
Never thought I'll come down so hard  An Englishman on Sunset 
     #G                    E            #F
Boulevard Now the raelians living by to say
B                E            #F                   #Dm                
When your world chews you up Spits you out and you blame it all on bad
#Gm                    E            #F 
luck You know no one's listening to you
#Dm       #F                
I've been travelling like a stranger to my ghost
Just let me know  Yeah...I'm never coming home again
All you need is imagination So come on kid,tell them how it is
All you need is imagination So come on kid,tell them how it is

Don't let it get you down A cup of salvation the strange face in the crowd
You know it doesn't mean anything to me
So wake up in a brand new place Lift your head let the sun beats down your face
You know someone's listening to you
I've been travelling like a stranger to my ghost
Just let me know Yeah...I'm never coming home again
All you need is imagination So come on kid,tell them how it is
All you need is imagination So come on kid,tell them how it is
It goes on and on and on and on til you recognize where it went wrong
Every now and then who are misunderstood
```
