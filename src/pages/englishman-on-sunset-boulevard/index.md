When your world chews you up Spits you out and you blame it all on bad
#Gm                    E            #F 
luck You know no one's listening to you
#Cm       #F                B              #Gm                
I've been travelling like a stranger to my ghost

Don't let it get you down A cup of salvation the strange face in the crowd
                         E           #F
You know it doesn't mean anything to me
B               E               #F                     #Dm                 #Gm
So wake up in a brand new place Lift your head let the sun beats down your face
                   E            #F
You know someone's listening to you
#Cm       #F                B              #Gm   
I've been travelling like a stranger to my ghost

        B             #F                 #Gm             #F
It goes on and on and on and on til you recognize where it went wrong
E                          #F
Every now and then who are misunderstood
