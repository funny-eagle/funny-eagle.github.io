Tribes Dancehall Chords A E #Fm D

Verse 1:
She's a gypsy queen, real tall and mean
She's an airplane, no one's ever seen
She's a firecracker, real dancehall master
She's a hurricane when you walk past her
She's the morning sun in the midnight wind
She'd sell her soul for all her sins
She'll come right at you, real Cleopatra
You take all you got, and you give it to her

Chorus:
Did you see that lightning in the sky
A window to my mind
It leaves me hypnotized
Somewhere better
Did you feel that thunder hit last night
A poison in my mind
It leaves me hypnotized
Somewhere better

Verse 2:
She's a striptease, real hard to please
She'll cheer you up, bring you to your knees
She's a movie star, fast sports car
She's a razor blade, she'll take you far
She's the ocean's cool, and your midnight ride
She's a devil's church, and a preacher's wife
She'll come right at you, real Cleopatra
You take all you got, and you give it to her

Chorus:
Did you see that lightning in the sky
A window to my mind
It leaves me hypnotized
Somewhere better
Did you feel that thunder hit last night
A poison in my mind
It leaves me hypnotized
Somewhere better

(Solo)

E                    D
I don't care for dancing
E                    D
but thanks for asking

Chorus:
Did you see that lightning in the sky
A window to my mind
It leaves me hypnotized
Somewhere better
Did you feel that thunder hit last night
A poison in my mind
It leaves me hypnotized
Somewhere better
