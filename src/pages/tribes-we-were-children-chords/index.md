B                         F#  
It was a day like today,
               Abm            E 
a sunday afternoon when they took you away
B        F#         Eb 
down to Hades in a shopping trolley
E 
with a magazine and a suitcase
B              F# 
They stole your clothes 
            Abm 
i took your watch 
          E 
i couldnt look you in the eye 
B              F#             E               E 
why its always those who you love the most you criticise


Chorus

B       F#         Abm         E 
Oh no stranger your just like me,
             B           F#          Abm            E 
these things happen we were children in the mid 90's
B       F#         Abm         E 
Oh no stranger your just like me,
       B           F#          Abm            E 
we get older they get younger it was you or me

Verse 2
B                       F#                Abm          E        
We stood there throwing ice cream in your hair how i solemly swear
B            F#                Eb (6th)    E (7th)
its the thing in life i regret the most... leaving you standing there
B                F#             Abm 
And if you asked me id pull my eyes out 
      E 
and when i woke up blind
B            F#           Eb (6th)
if you forgave i would sleep at night 
E (7th)
knowing i'd led a good life.


Chorus

B       F#         Abm         E 
Oh no stranger your just like me,
             B           F#          Abm            E 
these things happen we were children in the mid 90's
B       F#         Abm         E 
Oh no stranger your just like me,
       B           F#          Abm            E 
we get older they get younger it was you or me
